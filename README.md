The classes were a code-along course on Deep Learning.
Here the neural network concept was explored. From the simplest neural network model, Single-Input-Single-Output Model, to Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output.
Understanding the concepts of Forward Propagation, Brute Force Learning Concept and Random Initialisation.
The entire project was coded in C-Language from scratch with no external libraries.
